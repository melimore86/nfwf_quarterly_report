This report includes work accomplished during October through December 2020. Implementation continues to be mostly smooth and the monitoring phase of our project is progressing in a timely fashion. To date, this project is on track both in budget and within timeline. ii. Updates on individual tasks. Task 1. Planning and Permitting A. Work performed on Task 1. All work on this task was completed by January of 2018. Performance of Task I as against the Task 1 Budget. All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule, or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. We currently have no existing or anticipated problems with completion of Task 1 and consider this part of the project completed. Task 2. Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan A. Work performed on Task 2. The Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen at minimum as a living document, and in reality, as an active, constant process. An updated version of the Adaptive Management Plan, and Biological Sampling Plan, were completed in June 2020. The elevation and biological sampling plans continue to evolve as we have now completed the second winter season of postconstruction oyster sampling, and ongoing water quality sampling. The variability displayed by each of the strata (substrate, harvest status, location) collected in the 2019/20 winter has been incorporated into our estimates of numbers samples required to achieve a known power of detecting change of particular magnitude for the 2020/2021 sampling period. B. Progress made towards Task 2 milestones. Updating of adaptive management plan, biological sampling plan, and work on updating elevation sampling plan. Performance of Task 2 as against the Task 2 Budget. Task 2 appears to be well within the timeline and budget as set out in the proposal. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 2. We do not anticipate any problems with implementation of Task 2. Task 3. Preconstruction Monitoring A. Work performed on Task 3. All phases of preconstruction monitoring have been completed as of December 2018. Progress made towards Task 3 milestones. All subtasks within Task 3 have been completed. C. Performance of Task 3 as against the Task 3 Budget. This task appears to be well within budget and the schedule of spending as identified in the proposal. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 3. This task is completed. Task 4. Construction A. Work performed on Task 4.

The center column of figures (Sites 1-3) represent the eastern side of the Lone Cabbage Reef restoration site. The left column of figures (Sites 4-6) represent the western side of the Lone Cabbage Reef restoration site. The right column of figures (Sites 7-9) represent sensors closest to shore in an area where salinity may be influenced by restoring Lone Cabbage Reef. The first two columns from the west (Sites 1-6) represent the inshore and offshore sides of the restoration reef.

River discharge is graphed as a daily mean in the light blue filled shape near the bottom of each graph. Daily mean salinity values (black line) are depicted using a 95% confidence interval (grey shaded region). Missing river discharge values are due to corrupt readings or missing equipment. Figure 2.

"],["river-discharge-figures.html", "Chapter 3 River Discharge Figures", " Chapter 3 River Discharge Figures A percentile is a value on a scale of one hundred that indicates the percent of a distribution that is equal to or below it. For example, on the map of daily streamflow conditions a river discharge at the 90th percentile is equal to or greater than 90 percent of the discharge values recorded on this day of the year during all years that measurements have been made. In general,a percentile greater than 75 is considered above normal, a percentile between 25 and 75 is considered normal, and a percentile less than 25 is considered below normal. These data are retrieved via the waterData package in R made available by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). These data are collected at the USGS 02323500 Suwannee River station near Wilcox, Florida.

"],["windrose-quarterly-figures.html", "Chapter 4 Windrose Quarterly Figures", " Chapter 4 Windrose Quarterly Figures A wind rose visualizes the frequency of winds blowing from a specific direction of a desired Date Range. The data used for this figure were collected via the rnoaa R Package at station CDRF1 (Cedar Key, Florida). The legend represents the wind speed ranging from low (2-4 m/s) to high (18-20 m/s) wind speeds. The cardinal directions on the outer part of the wind rose indicate the direction of the wind. The Frequency is displayed as the lowest to highest percentage frequency of a wind speed occuring in a given direction, by the size of the wind magnitude polygon. Wind data are updated periodically through USGS (monthly basis).

River discharge is essentially a second treatment in this restoration project (after the rebuilding of the reef) because it is the freshwater from the Suwannee River that Lone Cabbage Reef is thought to detain thus possibly promoting lower salinity. River discharge patterns in the Suwanee River basin may be changing over decadal scales due to changing climate, as is hypothesized for large rivers in the Gulf of Mexico (Neupane et al. 2019). For the period of record for the USGS Wilcox gauge (02323500) which begins in October 1930, we created a heat map that demonstrates for each month and year the deviation in river discharge (as a percentage) from the period of record average (Figures 23-25). Figure 1. Heat map of Suwannee River deviations in mean daily discharge by year and month from USGS Wilcox gauge (02322500) for the period of record measured as deviation from the average by month for period of record. White color for a given month and year is a month when river discharge is similar (with +/- 10%) to the period of record average, while blue to dark blue colors represent increasing discharge levels deviating as a percentage from the long-term average. Red to dark red colors conversely equal increasingly low discharge levels (below the period of record average). The black colors are months when data are not available. Figure 2.
