Salinity and river discharge data collected from autonomous sensors from the Lone Cabbage Reef restoration site near Suwannee, FL. Each graph represents a sensor location, with top of page as north, and right of page as east. The center column of figures (Sites 1-3) represent the eastern side of the Lone Cabbage Reef restoration site. The left column of figures (Sites 4-6) represent the western side of the Lone Cabbage Reef restoration site. The right column of figures (Sites 7-9) represent sensors closest to shore in an area where salinity may be influenced by restoring Lone Cabbage Reef. The first two columns from the west (Sites 1-6) represent the inshore and offshore sides of the restoration reef. The primary y-axis is Salinity (ppt, parts per thousand), and the secondary y-axis is Suwannee River discharge (CFS, cubic feet per second) measured at USGS Wilcox station 02323500 on the Suwannee River. River discharge is graphed as a daily mean in the light blue filled shape near the bottom of each graph. Daily mean salinity values (black line) are depicted using a 95% confidence interval (grey shaded region). Missing river discharge values are due to corrupt readings or missing equipment. Figure 2.

"],["river-discharge-figures.html", "Chapter 3 River Discharge Figures", " Chapter 3 River Discharge Figures A percentile is a value on a scale of one hundred that indicates the percent of a distribution that is equal to or below it. For example, on the map of daily streamflow conditions a river discharge at the 90th percentile is equal to or greater than 90 percent of the discharge values recorded on this day of the year during all years that measurements have been made. In general,a percentile greater than 75 is considered above normal, a percentile between 25 and 75 is considered normal, and a percentile less than 25 is considered below normal. These data are retrieved via the waterData package in R made available by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). These data are collected at the USGS 02323500 Suwannee River station near Wilcox, Florida. This site is located in Levy County, Florida (latitude 29.58968 and longitude -82.93651 in degrees). Figure 1.

"],["windrose-quarterly-figures.html", "Chapter 4 Windrose Quarterly Figures", " Chapter 4 Windrose Quarterly Figures A wind rose visualizes the frequency of winds blowing from a specific direction of a desired Date Range. The data used for this figure were collected via the rnoaa R Package at station CDRF1 (Cedar Key, Florida). The legend represents the wind speed ranging from low (2-4 m/s) to high (18-20 m/s) wind speeds. The cardinal directions on the outer part of the wind rose indicate the direction of the wind. The Frequency is displayed as the lowest to highest percentage frequency of a wind speed occuring in a given direction, by the size of the wind magnitude polygon. Wind data are updated periodically through USGS (monthly basis). Windrose from December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 Windrose from Janauary 1, 2021 to January 31, 2021 Windrose from February 1, 2021 to February 28, 2021 "],["river-discharge-heat-map.html", "Chapter 5 River Discharge Heat Map", " Chapter 5 River Discharge Heat Map Suwannee River discharge is known to influence salinity in Suwannee Sound (Orlando et al. 1993) and lags between Suwannee River discharge and oyster counts have been observed (Moore et al. 2020). River discharge is essentially a second treatment in this restoration project (after the rebuilding of the reef) because it is the freshwater from the Suwannee River that Lone Cabbage Reef is thought to detain thus possibly promoting lower salinity. River discharge patterns in the Suwanee River basin may be changing over decadal scales due to changing climate, as is hypothesized for large rivers in the Gulf of Mexico (Neupane et al. 2019). For the period of record for the USGS Wilcox gauge (02323500) which begins in October 1930, we created a heat map that demonstrates for each month and year the deviation in river discharge (as a percentage) from the period of record average (Figures 23-25). Figure 1. Heat map of Suwannee River deviations in mean daily discharge by year and month from USGS Wilcox gauge (02322500) for the period of record measured as deviation from the average by month for period of record. White color for a given month and year is a month when river discharge is similar (with +/- 10%) to the period of record average, while blue to dark blue colors represent increasing discharge levels deviating as a percentage from the long-term average. Red to dark red colors conversely equal increasingly low discharge levels (below the period of record average). The black colors are months when data are not available. Figure 2. Heat map of Suwannee River deviations in mean daily discharge by year and month from USGS Wilcox gauge (02323500) for 2005-2021 measured as deviation from the average by month for period of record.
